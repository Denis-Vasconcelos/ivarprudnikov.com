Life long learning is a challenge. Not only you are supposed to learn but also choose which direction to go. It is a bit easier when you are a technologist of sorts as there are plenty of resources online one can follow, plenty of courses one can buy.

In the last couple of years I made almost no exceptions to what I learned as content was all in the realm of IT. Unfortunately there was little challenge involved as I was marginally improving. Furthermore it felt like a vicious cycle - quite easy to believe in the idea that the most important thing to do next is related to what you do now.

I've tried what looked like at the time 2 different courses, one was artificial intelligence in [Udacity](https://udacity.com) and another - [AWS certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). On the surface they seem to be different but the value and effect was the same, they became just another couple of virtue signals on my CV. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying time spent learning was wasted, in contrary it was very informative. My point here is that I was expanding my knowledge but if you imagine this process as if it was on a map then I was just exploring the same corner/location I was already in. Might be it is easier to follow similar path one used to take every day.

## Reevaluation

It is not alien for developers to feel like they need to learn everything due to new technologies sprouting every day, due to lack of confidence, due to competition in keeping existing or finding a better job. But what is it you have to learn to move forward?

In my case I tried to figure out couple of parts of this issue:
- what are my weaknesses
- what others think my weaknesses are
- what am I aiming at
- what experience is necessary to jump higher on a career ladder
- what is missing in my experience

These questions might look very dry but if you sit down and try to write answers, be prepared to spend some time. 

### Goals

I always aspired to various leaders and wanted to become one but in a sense never got there, yet. But as soon as I started to attempt bridging the gap of where I am at the moment and where I want to be it became evident what was missing.

Every time you go to a conference and see people on stage or listen to some podcast and hear an interview, there is this person which is in some way a figure of the leader, why would you listen to that person otherwise. Similarly at work when manager/executive speaks s/he grabs your attention, sometimes talking nonsense though. These examples serve as an indicator of what is important if you ever needed or wanted to go higher - it is simple everyday activity which is _talking_. Now there is a difference when you need to talk in front of the audience compared to a chat in a pub, the main one being - fear.

Speaking well is a skill anyone who is in leadership needs to command well. Not many people will like a meek inarticulate individual, let alone do as he says.

## Decisions

There are couple of ways you could practice speaking skills but none of those will exclude speaking. Practice makes perfect.

There was this idea at the time to get on stage. If you watch stand-up comedians or some act in a theatre it might look like the very thing you want to do or learn. I started searching for drama, improv schools but due to my location I couldn't find anything. Then I thought of meetups and that it could provide me with great opportunity as I could just speak about tech, but again the issue was location so meetups are still postponed until later.

One day I read a blog post, [an interview between software engineer I once met and John Papa](https://blog.drinkbird.com/john-papa-interview-voxxed-days-athens-2018/) - influential speaker/contributor in developer community. A tiny bit of that conversation caught my attention where John mentioned [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/). I did hear about it before but it never occurred to me to search for that organisation around the location I live.

### Surprise

It was quite intriguing to find a club which has its twice a month meetings within a walking distance from my home. I did not hesitate much and after reading about it more was convinced of necessity to try it out.

Club meetings take place in a hotel, there is a conference room where roughly 30 people gather. It was one of March meetings that I have gone to if my memory is not lying. As part of the operation there was a greeter, a person welcoming everyone to the event. Guests are always welcome, website said, but I was still _a bit_ nervous not knowing what to expect inside.

Room was full of people but few seats were still available, I got to one of the tables which was behind sitting area, the other one was in front of the audience but I had no courage to start from there. When coming closer I saw that table contained couple of name tags, box of cash, evening programme printed in colour and there was also a lady sitting behind. I was pleasantly greeted and politely asked if it was my first time in the club. After a short chit chat I went to the first row of chairs and took a seat waiting for all to begin. 

Club meetings start by following an agreed procedure, introduction of programme and people representing roles required for further execution of an event, like grammarian, _ah_ counter, timer, speech evaluators and also speakers. Roles change from meeting to meeting in a volunteering fashion among members, but some roles do not change throughout the year, one of those being a club president.

I was fascinated with it from the time it started as it was very well organised and in some metaphorical way looked like a clockwork. I did enjoy all of it including some great speeches and the welcoming smiles over the tea break.

## Ice Breaker

After you join the club the first important thing that happens is your first speech which is called _Ice Breaker_. On the one hand it is simple as you have to talk about yourself but preparation should not be ignored, you should write it down. In addition it is expected to follow a basic structure and talk for 4-6 minutes.

Documentation and videos are available on toastmasters website where you can also find pdf document helping you to structure your speech.

I went to penultimate club meeting before it suspends its activity over summer and decided to schedule my Ice Breaker. Bravery for such a thing primarily came from thinking that I will not have free _slots_ available before summer but I was wrong - there is always a space in calendar for Ice Breakers. Dizziness filled my gut but I knew this step is necessary to break your stage fears and start progressing as a _speaker_.

In my case it was a train ride where I got the idea for the speech, so I quickly grabbed my notepad and started writing what came to the mind. It was rough and unusable but later I could reform and rewrite it into something which was not very annoying.

As far as I understood speeches were to be rehearsed. There are couple of ways you can do it, the simplest - talking to the mirror. I did try mirror but it was hard to focus so I went on speaking without it and later started recording myself on camera which really helped. When I tried my first attempt in front of camera, the speech took me 15 minutes!
